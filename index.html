        <p> California is well known for a lot of things. It's warm sunny beaches, the glistening coastline, or even just Hollywood. A lot of that is more to the south of the state however. Further north the water is cold and the waves crash harshly against the cliffs. While it does get warm, the weather can be a bit more unpredictable with a high chance of frost in the winter.</p>
